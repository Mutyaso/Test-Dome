<ul>
<li><b>Sums Of Two:</b> <br>
A function that, given a list and a target sum, returns zero-based indices of any two distinct elements 
whose sum is equal to the target sum. If there are no such elements, the function would return the proper message.
For example, FindTwoSum(new List<int>() { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 }, 12) should return any of the following tuples of indices:

    1, 4 (3 + 9 = 12)
    2, 3 (5 + 7 = 12)
    3, 2 (7 + 5 = 12)
    4, 1 (9 + 3 = 12)
</li>
<br>
<li><b>Frog Leap:</b><br>
A frog only moves forward, but it can move in steps 1 inch long or in jumps 2 inches long. A frog can cover the same 
distance using different combinations of steps and jumps.
This calculates the number of different combinations a frog can use to cover a given distance.
For example, a distance of 3 inches can be covered in three ways: step-step-step, step-jump, and jump-step.
